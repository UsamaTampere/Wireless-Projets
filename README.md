MATLAB simulation of a 16-QAM wireless communication system with LMS equalization and Hamming ECC

# Wireless Communication System Simulation in MATLAB

This project simulates a basic digital communication system using 16-QAM modulation, root-raised cosine pulse shaping, a multipath fading channel, and an LMS equalizer. It also includes error control coding using a Hamming(7,4) code.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- 16-QAM modulation and Gray mapping
- RRC pulse shaping and matched filtering
- Channel effects using a given impulse response
- AWGN noise addition
- LMS equalizer for channel compensation
- BER analysis before and after equalization
- Hamming(7,4) encoding and decoding

## ðŸ“Š Requirements

- MATLAB (tested on R2021a or newer)
- Signal Processing Toolbox

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

Run `main.m` directly in MATLAB.

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Outputs

- Transmitted and received constellations
- Eye diagrams
- BER results
- Frequency responses
